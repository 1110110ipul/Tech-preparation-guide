# Tech-preparation-guide
This repo consist of tech preparation guide starting with frontend focused but will scale to other areas as well, since i like to do complete software engineering in my spare time, and i am dumb so i forget what and where i studied something

It's not complete, and never be complete it's always work inprogress, since technology keeps on changing, so we have to keep updating things here and there, and contributions are welcome. 

# Why ?
  so, while preparing for preparing for job switch, i was clueless after 2 years of not doing anything related to looking for job, so thought it would be better to have a single place where i can come back and look at things to prepare for future interviews.

  - state Managament :
    -  NGRX if you are into angular development
    -  Redux if you are into react/nextjs , there are many more but this will provide you good grounds to use any other state management in future
   
  - Coding tool and code management setup (My personal preference) :
      - editor : vs code
      - ts/js file code format : prettier
      - HTML, css , vs code default or prettier any thing works fine
      - VS code extensions :
        -  code snap for taking beautiful screenshot of your code, since sometime you might have to share screenshot with peers to understand some part of your code and you have to show them what's cool
        -  Live share : great tool to collaborate by sharing your local code editor to any remote dev
        -  gitlens
        -  github pull request : great to check all the pull request in your/your organization github account once authorized access are provided
        -  github codespace : open your vs code in browser and manage in your repo in any machine even if you don't have vs code in that machine
             to quickly open any repo in github codespace in browser, press space + '.' and voila. 
        -  docker
        -  JAVA extension pack , to run java based project which includes maven, gradle etc.
        -  Spring Boot extension pack, to run springboot based java services and have great UI to handle all the service inside VSCode itself
        -  Thunder client, good replacement for postman in VScode itself
        -  Python extension pack, to run python based projects includes django
      - must know VS code features/shortcuts :
        -  ctrl+D : multi select of the same text in project
        -  ctrl + shift + f : global search
        -  ctrl + p : global search any files , or use ':' and add line number to jump to any line number in current file, great when you have large project
        -  ctrl + ` : toggle terminal in vs code, without moving mouse to close again and again
        -  ctrl + shift + ` : add new powershell to your terminal
        -  ctrl + q :  to quickly jump into any side bar tab
        -  ctrl + tab : to jump between opened files
        -  ctrl + '+' : to zoom in your editor
        -  ctrl + '-' : to zoom out your editor
        -  keep autosave on, some time it can be annoying if hot rebuild is on, but mostly great since you are not gonna lose 99% of time your changes
        -  ctrl + f12 or ctrl + right-click : jump to implementation of function
        -  shift + alt + A : toggle block comment
        
        - PORTS : great feature to quickly host your localhost website to www using azure clouds probably(since it's microsoft product) by port forwarding your localhost site and show case your project to your friends, or test your site in different devices.
        - Zen Mode : great when you don't want to focus into anything else

          There are many more things to do with vs code, keep exploring
